# My Raspberry Pi Pico W Dev Files

## Webserver

This is a simple webserver that supports adding directories directly from html files. It is however, not a full webserver at the moment. There are no plans to expand this.

## Creds file

The creds file is a simple file type i created to store credentials. It is not encrypted and is not secure. It is a simple way to store credentials. I use it for storing wifi credentials. It is however not encrypted or secured in any way. It is just a simple way to store credentials and information such as wifi info and api keys for internal use in the pi.
